The case is the biggest component of a computer system. It holds all of the internal components and regulates airflow to keep the temperatures cool. Cases can come in many different sizes (known as form factors). The size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard, since it is the largest component of most computers. Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case. Form factors for rack-mounted and blade servers may include precise external dimensions as well, since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures. Currently, the most popular form factor for desktop computers is ATX, although microATX and small form factors have also become very popular for a variety of uses.
